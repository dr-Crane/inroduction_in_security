# -Injection
An attacker can use entry fields to inject grammatically valid constructions that subvert application 
logic. This is a way to inject malicious code into an application, most often based on SQL, NoSQL, OS, or LDAP.

Positive Technologies analysts have identified SQL injection as the most popular attack on web applications (27%).

Most commonly, injection attacks occur when a web application fails to restrict user input in site forms and entry fields.
Malicious code introduced to the application in such fields can yield access to sensitive information or even administrator rights.
